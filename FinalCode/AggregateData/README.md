This folder contains three items: two folders containing multiple different data files and a Python script that is used to aggregate these multiple data files into one file that contains all of the data. The data files used to create the final data file include things such as box office numbers, critic reviews, release dates, and sentiment scores. All of these different types of data were aggregated into the two final csv files, one for 2016 and one for 2017. The data was added to these files in a format that was easy to use for further steps of the prediction process.
